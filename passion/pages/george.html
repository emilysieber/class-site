    <h3>Trendy George</h3>
    <p>Straight and serviceable. He favored plaid (shirts, sweaters, scarves, probably socks too), pleated Dockers in all colors, cardigan sweaters and anoraks. For a little excitement, he opted for an argyle pattern.</p>
    <p>“The guy’s cheap,” says Charmaine Simmons, costume designer, of George. “That’s where his look came from,” recalling shopping expeditions for him in strange, far-flung clothing warehouses “like jobbers.”</p>
