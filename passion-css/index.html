    <p> <em>Seinfeld</em> was always on in my family home when I was younger. I remember walking by my parents' room and hearing that iconic jazz musical number alongside laugh tracks every few minutes. Not until I was 18 and living in my freshman dorm room did I dive into the <em>Seinfeld</em> universe myself. The comedy was enough for me to keep watching but I would always look intently at the outfits that all the characters wore. I loved the neutral colors, the loose fits, the different textures, etc. It was the effortlessness that all the characters had that drew me in to their clothes.<br>
    <br>
    Over <em>Seinfeld</em>’s 9 year run, it has done a wonderful job of showcasing the casts wild (and not so wild) adventures while keeping a wardrobe that is uncomplicated, cool, and impressively fits each of the characters personalities. This style is frequently described as being “Normcore”.<br>
    <br>
    "Normcore is a unisex fashion trend characterized by unpretentious, average-looking clothing. Normcore fashion includes jeans, t-shirts, sweats, button-downs, and sneakers. Clothing is considered to be normcore when it is attractive and comfortable and is viewed as "normal" by the majority of people."</p>
