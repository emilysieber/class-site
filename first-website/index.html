    <p>I don't know how to build and power a refrigerator, or program a computer, but I don't know how to make a fishhook or a pair of shoes, either. I could learn. We all can learn. That's the neat thing about technologies. They're what we can learn to do. And all science fiction is, in one way or another, <em>technological</em>. <strong>Even when it's written by people who don't know what the word means.</strong> <small>All the same, I agree with my reviewer that I don't write hard science fiction.</small> Maybe I write easy science fiction. Or maybe the hard stuff's inside, hidden â€” like bones, as opposed to an exoskeleton....</p>
